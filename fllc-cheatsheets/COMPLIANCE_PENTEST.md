## NIST 800-53 — Key Controls for Pentesting

| Control | Description | How to Test |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| AC-2 | Account Management | Enumerate accounts, check for stale/default |
| AC-6 | Least Privilege | Test privilege escalation paths |
| AU-2 | Audit Events | Verify logging captures pentest activity |
| IA-2 | MFA | Test authentication bypass without MFA |
| IA-5 | Authenticator Management | Test password strength, hash cracking |
| RA-5 | Vulnerability Scanning | Run Nessus/OpenVAS, confirm findings |
| SC-7 | Boundary Protection | Test firewall rules, network segmentation |
| SC-13 | Cryptographic Protection | Check cipher suites, certificate validity |
| SI-2 | Flaw Remediation | Verify patch levels, exploit known CVEs |
| SI-10 | Information Input Validation | Test injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.) |

## PCI-DSS 4.0 — Pentest Requirements

| Requirement | Testing Approach |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 11.3.1 | Internal vulnerability scan quarterly |
| 11.3.2 | External vulnerability scan quarterly (ASV) |
| 11.4.1 | External penetration test annually |
| 11.4.2 | Internal penetration test annually |
| 11.4.3 | Pentest after significant infrastructure changes |
| 11.4.4 | Segmentation testing every 6 months |

### PCI Pentest Scope
- All systems in the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)
- All systems connected to the CDE
- Network segmentation controls
- Application-layer testing for web apps that process card data

## Report Writing Tips

1. **Lead with business impact**, not technical jargon
2. **Map every finding** to at least one compliance control
3. **Provide remediation steps** with specific commands/configurations
4. **Include evidence** — screenshots, command output, packet captures
5. **Prioritize** using CVSS + business context, not just CVSS alone
6. **Set remediation timelines**: Critical=72h, High=30d, Medium=90d, Low=180d
7. **Track retesting** — document when findings are verified as fixed
